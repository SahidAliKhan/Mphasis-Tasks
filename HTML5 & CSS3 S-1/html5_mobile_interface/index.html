      <aside id="name1"> <p>I farm in partnership with my brother. We’ve been in farming all our lives and our family delivered milk to doorsteps for over 70 years. Around the time I left school, we had the opportunity to expand the farm which has grown from 70 cows to 250 today.<aside style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: right;" ><p>"East Devon dairy farmer Rob Nancekivell recently joined our Dairy Sector Council."</p></p></aside></aside>
      <aside id="name2"><p>It’s really dry here at the moment and there’s not a lot of grass so I’m planning on moving our youngstock onto our silage fields that aren’t normally grazed. Rather than cutting the grass for a very poor third cut, I’m trying to sort some temporary fencing and water solutions which is keeping me busy. That and getting ready to combine 100 acres of wheat in a week so. The business of farming never stops.It’s really dry here at the moment and there’s not a lot of grass so I’m planning on moving our youngstock onto our silage fields that aren’t normally grazed.
